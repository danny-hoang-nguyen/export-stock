# export-stock
When surfing trading webs, I see that there is not export button without asking email. I do not want to give my email and I still want to have all information downloaded then I can do whatever I want with it. That is the reason why I created this project with some python code to pull data and save them as csv file.
Since that moment, I can use Pandas to check some figures.
This code is especially created for specific website. Hence each website has their own way of loading data, so the code cannot be generalized.
Hopefully, I can build some common code to save some time.
Enjoy the result,
Thanks for reading.
